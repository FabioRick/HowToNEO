# HowToNEO - SmartContract

You can create directories here to better split the data :). Create an MD inside that directory to explain what are you doing there.

## Getting Start

### [Frameworks](Framework/Framework.md)
>This is how to use the NEO's frameworks.
How to use the functions, what you can do or do not!!

### [Installation](Installation/Installation.md)
>This is how to set up your enviroment to start develop **Smart Contracts for NEO Blockchain!**

### [Introduction](Introduction/Introduction.md)
>What you should know after you get start!!

### [First DApp](First_DApp/First_DApp.md)
>Now that your enviroment is ready to start, let's move for our first DApp. It's just the beginning of your path inside NEO and after it **you can take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes!!**

### [Best Practices](Best_Practices/Best_Practices.md)
>**How beaultiful and clean you code can be? What you should or should not do?**

### [Testing and Deploying your Smart Contract](Testing_and_Publishing/Testing_and_Publishing.md)
>After we get our AVM file, **what to do? How to test? How can i make it aviable to the world?**

### [Interaction with the SC inside the Blockchain](Interaction/Interaction.md)
>At this point our SC is running inside a Private, Test or Main net and we need to interact with this. **That's when the SDK comes to the table.**

### [Examples](Examples/Examples.md)
>Here is some examples of codes. Official and non official.

### [Tips](Tips/Tips.md)
>Now that everything is a little bit clear in our mind and we start to code, something happen. **What should i do? Is it possible? How can i move on?***. This part is how to deal with problems such as Runtime randomness, how to get amount of assets attached to the transactions, etc.
